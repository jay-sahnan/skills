# LinkedIn Algorithm & Format Research (2025 Data)

What actually works on LinkedIn, backed by data from 2M+ posts.

## Content Format Performance

Reach multipliers by format (personal profiles):

| Format | Reach Multiplier | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Polls | 1.64x | Highest reach, 200%+ above average |
| Documents/PDFs | 1.45x | Carousels work exceptionally well |
| Images | 1.18x | Single images still perform |
| Video | 1.10x | Down 200% from 2024 |
| Text-only | 0.88x | Below average reach |

**Key insight**: PDFs and carousels dominate. Video reach collapsed in 2025.

## Posting Frequency Impact

Impressions per post based on weekly frequency:

| Posts/Week | Additional Impressions |
|------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Baseline |
| 2-5 | +1,182 per post |
| 6-10 | +5,001 per post |
| 11+ | +17,000 per post |

**Constraint**: Never post more than once per 24 hours (reduces reach for newer posts).

## Engagement Value Hierarchy

Not all engagement is equal:

| Action | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Save | 5x a like, 2x a comment |
| Comment | 15x a like |
| Share | High (varies) |
| Like | Baseline |

**Critical**: Fewer than 3% of posts reach the "save threshold." Create content worth bookmarking.

## Optimal Post Specifications

**Length**:
- Personal profiles: 800-1,000 characters optimal
- Company pages: 600-750 characters
- 900-1,500 characters for thought leadership

**Readability**:
- Target 4th-grade reading level
- Posts above 10th-grade level see 35% less reach
- Maximum 4 lines per paragraph
- Heavy whitespace improves scannability

**Hashtags**:
- Maximum 3 hashtags (recommended)
- 3-5: slight visibility reduction
- 6+: serious reach damage
- Never use hashtags inline—place at end

## Critical Timing Data

**First hour rule**:
- Posts with engagement in first 30-60 minutes get 2.3x more views
- Author responses within 30 minutes = 64% more total comments
- Reply to every comment immediately after posting

**Best posting times**:
- Primary: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM
- Secondary: Monday/Friday, 12-2 PM
- Weekend engagement: 50% lower

**Content lifespan**: Posts now visible 2-3 weeks (up from days). Evergreen content matters more.

## Link Penalties

External links hurt reach:

| Links | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| 1 link | Lowest reach (avoid) |
| 2-3 links | No improvement |
| 0 links | Best initial reach |

**Workaround**: Post without link, add in first comment after engagement starts.

## Algorithm Priorities (2025)

LinkedIn now weights:

1. **Consumption rate** - How much of your content people actually read
2. **Expertise signals** - Consistent posting on same topics builds authority
3. **Content sequencing** - Related posts in logical progression get 62% more engagement
4. **Mobile optimization** - 72% access via mobile, 91% browse on mobile

## What Gets Suppressed

The algorithm penalizes:
- Engagement pods (97% detection accuracy)
- Engagement bait ("Comment YES...")
- Multiple posts in 24 hours
- Excessive hashtags (6+)
- External links in main post
- Viral-style content without professional relevance

## Recommended Content Mix

Based on performance data:
- 60% educational carousels/PDFs (highest reach)
- 30% thought leadership text posts (builds authority)
- 10% engagement-focused content (polls, questions)

## The Save Metric

Saves are the most valuable engagement:
- 1 save = 5x reach value of 1 like
- Saved posts = 130% higher follow rate
- Create content people want to reference later

**What gets saved**: Frameworks, how-tos, data visualizations, actionable checklists.
